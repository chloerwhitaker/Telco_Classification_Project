 #Telco Classification Project 

    ## About the Project 

    ## Project Goals
        My goal is to identify the drivers of churn at Telco and the liklihhood that a current customer will churn, so that we can develop custom solutions that increase retention. 
     
    ## Project Description
        A huge expense for telecommunication companies is aquiring new customers. If these companies can retain current customers, they can save on the cost of aquisition. 
        In this project we will look at factors that contribute to customers churnning or not churnning. By identifiying the drivers of churn, we will then develop a model to predict how likely a future customer is to churn or not. We will also recommend tailored solutions to keep customers happy and with the company. Keeping customers = saving money, and we can help telecommunication companies do both. 
    
    ## Initial Questions
        - Are customers with a certain service type more or less likely to churn? 
            - Specifically are customers with fiber more likely to churn? 
        - What month are customers most likely to churn in? 
            - Does this depend on their contract/service type? 
        - Do the customers that churn have a higher monthly cost than those that do not churn? 
        - Do the customers that churn havel more or less lines than those how don't?
